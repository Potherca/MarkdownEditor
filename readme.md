# Markdown Editor

In order to get this tool working you should clone or download this repo.
In the repo you need to init the submodules.

An example folder has been included. If you want to be able to use GIT to keep 
track of changes you will need to `git init` inside that folder. Also, the web
user will need to have write access to the `.git` folder otherwise the tool will 
bork.

Please take a look at the credentials file to see how you can add user login 
credentials.

Also note that the entry point is `MarkdownEditor-Persistence/www/`.

This is ugly you do not run the tool on its own (sub)domain.
